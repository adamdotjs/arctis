# Arctis Theme          

## NORD x NOCTIS
### My two favorite themes put together for comfortable coding all day long.

When working in bright light or using multiple monitors with different foreground brightness levels, I personally find that having too dark of a theme can be straining to the eyes. Arctis aims to solve that problem by maintaining strong legibility and contrast in all lighting conditions without relying on switching between dark and light themes.

To accomplish this, it borrows the brilliant syntax highlighting (with some minor color tweaks) from Noctis and combines it with the very relaxing and easy-to-stare-at UI from Nord. The result is what I think is truly a perfect combination.

Keeping accessibility in mind, all syntax colors maintain at least WCAG 4.5:1 minimum contrast.

## v0.0.4 now includes themed colors for the new built-in bracket pair highlighter. Enable the following to use:
```
"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
```

## Font settings as shown in screenshots:
```
"editor.fontFamily": "Source Code Variable",
"editor.fontWeight": "500",
"editor.lineHeight": "1.7"
```

## Credits:
Full credit of this theme shared between [Noctis](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liviuschera.noctis) and [Nord](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code), as this is simply a combination of the two but with minor tweaks to fit them together.

The syntax colors were adjusted to suit my own idea of what works best, done so on a monitor calibrated to 120cd/m2 but tested from as low as 80 up to 160.

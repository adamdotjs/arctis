# Arctis Theme

---

[![Preview in vscode.dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/preview%20in-vscode.dev-blue)](https://vscode.dev/theme/avidworks.arctis)

Arctis borrows the brilliant syntax highlighting from Noctis and combines it with Nord's UI, with color adjustments to maximize readability. The result is what I think is a lovely combination and should be accessible for most users.

Several versions were built upon the base theme and are now included, including:

- **Arctis** - Base theme with Nord UI
- **Arctis Dark** - Darkened version of the base theme
- **Artcis Moon** - A moonlit version of Arctis Dark, inspired by [Moonlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=atomiks.moonlight).
- **Arctis Night** - Arctis Night, inspired by the lovely [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) theme.
- **Arctis High Contrast** - A solid black background to really make the code stand out.
- **Arctis Light** - Light variant of the base theme for those who prefer them.

Keeping accessibility in mind, most syntax colors maintain at least WCAG 4.5:1 minimum contrast.

#### Credits:

Full credit of this theme shared between [Noctis](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liviuschera.noctis) and [Nord](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code), as this is simply a combination of the two but with minor tweaks to fit them together.

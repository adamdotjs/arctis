# Arctis Theme

## NORD x NOCTIS

### My two favorite themes put together for comfortable coding all day long.

Arctis borrows the brilliant syntax highlighting from Noctis (with color tweaks) and combines it with the beautiful, soothing UI from Nord. The result is what I think is a perfect combination.

Keeping accessibility in mind, most syntax colors maintain at least WCAG 4.5:1 minimum contrast.

```
"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
```

## Font settings as shown in screenshots:

```
"editor.fontFamily": "Cascadia Code",

Full credit of this theme shared between [Noctis](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liviuschera.noctis) and [Nord](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code), as this is simply a combination of the two but with minor tweaks to fit them together.

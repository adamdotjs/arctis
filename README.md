# Arctis Theme

## NORD x NOCTIS

### My two favorite themes put together for comfortable coding all day long.

Arctis borrows the brilliant syntax highlighting from Noctis (with color tweaks to maintain the original contrast ratios) and combines it with the beautiful, soothing UI from Nord. The result is what I think is truly a perfect combination.

#### v1.0 now includes an additional option with a darker UI!

Keeping accessibility in mind, all syntax colors maintain at least WCAG 4.5:1 minimum contrast.

## Now includes Nord's theming for the new built in bracket colorizer. Enable the following to use:

```
"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
```

## Font settings as shown in screenshots:

```
"editor.fontFamily": "Office Code Pro",
"editor.fontWeight": "400",
"editor.lineHeight": "1.8"
```

Full credit of this theme shared between [Noctis](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liviuschera.noctis) and [Nord](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code), as this is simply a combination of the two but with minor tweaks to fit them together.

## [2.1.4] - 05-08-2022

- Darken white text on editor slightly, as it was overpowering syntax colors.

## [2.1.2] - 05-08-2022

- Github issue: Reduce brightness of bracket match border (#5). Slightly darken UI text to reduce distraction from editor (#6).

## [2.1.1] - 05-05-2022

- Fix UI of light theme, settings didn't match new variants of dark theme.

## [2.1.0] - 05-04-2022

## [2.0.2] - 04-30-2022

- Fix purple charts color

## [2.0.1] - 04-30-2022

## [2.0.0] - 04-30-2022

- Add Moon variant. Final version.

## [1.5.2] - 04-29-2022

- Revert to previous variants. New colors were oversaturated. Can't leave anything alone...

## [1.5.1] - 04-29-2022

- Fix green syntax. Ugh. Sorry if anyone has to keep re-installing updates, but I think it's finally done!

## [1.5.0] - 04-29-2022

- Decided to increase the saturation of the syntax highlighting quite drastically to help readability. Colors were chosen from Tailwind's color library. In case people preferred the desaturated look from before, I created new Muted versions to be more in line with previous versions.

## [1.4.2] - 04-29-2022

- Adjust bracket colors of light theme

## [1.4.1] - 04-28-2022

- Fix variant name

## [1.4.0] - 04-28-2022

- Add Arctis High Contrast theme. Adjust bracket pair colors per user request.

## [1.3.3] - 04-06-2022

- Adjust syntax colors by one point brighter. Some colors appeared dim.

## [1.3.1] - 04-05-2022

- Adjust saturation to make syntax stand out more against backgrounds.

## [1.3.0] - 3-18-2022

- Adjusted html/jsx tag puncation and comment colors, and added the "Night" theme variant inspired by Night Owl.

## [1.2.1] - 12-16-2021

- Adjust saturation of pink syntax color. Appeared far too saturated in live coding.

## [1.2.0] - 12-16-2021

- Adjust poor contrast of tag colors and publish first version of light theme

## [1.1.0] - 12-15-2021

- Adjusted syntax colors to better mesh between the two themes, and help cut down on some of the harsh contrast with a few of the colors when using the dark variant.

## [1.0.0] - 11-09-2021

- Added an additional option with a darker UI. Calling this release V1 as it's pretty much complete now.

## [0.1.0] - 10-20-2021

- Readjusted some of the colors to maintain the original contrast ratios from the Noctis syntax colors. I was finding that because a lot of the colors were so similar, it was hard to distinguish certain things from one another.

## [0.0.9] - 09-06-2021

- Fine tuned the syntax colors a little more. Some colors seemed to attract too much focus.

## [0.0.5] - 09-05-2021

- More tweaks. Someday I'll make up my mind, sorry if you have to keep updating it!

## [0.0.4] - 09-04-2021

- Added themed support for the new bracket pair colorizer feature. Default colors adjusted to match the saturation of the theme colors.

## [0.0.3] - 09-03-2021

- Fixed two deprecated settings in config file

## [0.0.2] - 09-03-2021

- Made minor adjustments to syntax colors to improve legibility and separation between different syntax.

## [0.0.1] - 08-29-2021

- Initial Release

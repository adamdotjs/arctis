## [1.3.1] - 04-05-2022

## [1.3.0] - 3-18-2022

- Adjusted html/jsx tag puncation and comment colors, and added the "Night" theme variant inspired by Night Owl.

## [1.2.1] - 12-16-2021

- Adjust saturation of pink syntax color. Appeared far too saturated in live coding.

## [1.2.0] - 12-16-2021

- Adjust poor contrast of tag colors and publish first version of light theme

## [1.1.0] - 12-15-2021

- Adjusted syntax colors to better mesh between the two themes, and help cut down on some of the harsh contrast with a few of the colors when using the dark variant.

## [1.0.0] - 11-09-2021

- Added an additional option with a darker UI. Calling this release V1 as it's pretty much complete now.

## [0.1.0] - 10-20-2021

- Readjusted some of the colors to maintain the original contrast ratios from the Noctis syntax colors. I was finding that because a lot of the colors were so similar, it was hard to distinguish certain things from one another.

## [0.0.9] - 09-06-2021

- Fine tuned the syntax colors a little more. Some colors seemed to attract too much focus.

## [0.0.5] - 09-05-2021

- More tweaks. Someday I'll make up my mind, sorry if you have to keep updating it!

## [0.0.4] - 09-04-2021

- Added themed support for the new bracket pair colorizer feature. Default colors adjusted to match the saturation of the theme colors.

## [0.0.3] - 09-03-2021

- Fixed two deprecated settings in config file

## [0.0.2] - 09-03-2021

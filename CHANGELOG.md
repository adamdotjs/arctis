## [0.1.0] - 10-20-2021

- Readjusted some of the colors to maintain the original contrast ratios from the Noctis syntax colors. I was finding that because a lot of the colors were so similar, it was hard to distinguish certain things from one another.

## [0.0.9] - 09-06-2021

- Fine tuned the syntax colors a little more. Some colors seemed to attract too much focus.

## [0.0.5] - 09-05-2021

- More tweaks. Someday I'll make up my mind, sorry if you have to keep updating it!

## [0.0.4] - 09-04-2021

- Added themed support for the new bracket pair colorizer feature. Default colors adjusted to match the saturation of the theme colors.

## [0.0.3] - 09-03-2021

- Fixed two deprecated settings in config file

## [0.0.2] - 09-03-2021

- Made minor adjustments to syntax colors to improve legibility and separation between different syntax.
